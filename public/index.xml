      <description>Sections  Resources Blogs Software Books  Hey there, Scott here, and I&amp;rsquo;m working towards my Masters in Statistics. I have spent a lot of time over the last several years reading material on personal development as the idea relates to most areas of life. When I come across people I inevitably want to share some of this information, and accompanying resources, with them. The only problem is I sometimes only have a few minutes with them, so this leads to the problem of how do I maximise my interaction with them.</description>
