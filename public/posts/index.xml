			<description>Welcome to my first post! This is just a little one to get this section started. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried building this site before with Jekyll, but I was running into some issues with adding content in a smooth fashion. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping blogdown will be a bit smoother of a process so that I can start sharing content that I hope will be of value.
Stay tuned!</description>
